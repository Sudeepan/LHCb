    "\n",
    "<li> H1_ProbK: An estimate of how likely the first particle is to be a kaon. In this analysis you are looking to analyse the decays of B mesons into three kaons. Hence you will wish to select events where the probabilities of the three paticles each being a kaon is high. </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> H1_ProbPi: An estimate of how likely the first particle is to be a pion. Since in your analysis the final state particles should not be pions, you will wish to select events where the probabilities of the three paticles each being a pion is low. </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> H1_Charge: The electric charge (in units of the electron charge) of the first particle.</li>\n",

    "<li>H1_isMuon: A binary value which states if the particle is likely to be a muon. As you wish your particles to be kaons you can check that this is false (0).</li> \n",

    "\n",
    "The additional variables that are provided are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>B_FlightDistance: The collision point of the protons is found from the tracks that are reconstructed that come from that point. The decay vertex of the B meson is reconstructed by looking for the point at which the three final state tracks meet. The distance between the collision point, where the B meson is created, and the decay point of the B meson, where the three final state particles are created, is the flight distance of the B meson. The B meson is a short lived particle and will typically travel a few mm to a cm before decaying.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>B_VertexChi2: You can find the B meson decay point (vertex) by finding the point at which these three final state tracks meet. In practice the measured tracks will not come from an exact point as they have measurement errors, but the best estimate of the point is found. The &chi;<sup>2</sup> (Chi2 or [chisquare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution)) is a statistical measure measure of how compatible the three tracks are from having come from a common point. A large value (greater than 1) suggests that the tracks do not really come from a common point, and hence it is more likely that they are not from a real B meson decay.  \n",
    "</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>H1_IPChi2: The impact parameter is defined as the perpendicular distance between the path of the particle and the proton-proton collision vertex. The three final state tracks come from the B meson decay point and hence should not point back to the collision vertex. Most of the tracks in an event are produced at the collision point and thus if a track does point back to the collision vertex it is an indication that it might not come from the B meson decay. The &chi;<sup>2</sup> is a measure of how compatible this track is from coming from the collision vertex taking the uncertainties into account.</li>\n",
